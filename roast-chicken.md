# Roasted chicken

I probably made 20 or 30 iterations of this recipe before landing on one that was optimized for maximum flavor without sacrificing crispy skin.

## buying a chicken

- always organic
- preferably pastured
- preferably fresh, not frozen
- always bone-in, skin on

## 24-48 hours before: dry-brine the chicken 

1. butcher the chicken into pieces, or [spatchcock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FnIbxvLBLw)
1. separate the skin from the meat on each piece so it's nearly detached<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>
1. pull back the skin on breasts, thighs and legs, and salt the meat directly with sea salt or kosher salt, 6 grams of salt per pound of chicken<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup>
1. spread chicken pieces out on a sheet or wire rack and place in fridge, uncovered<sup>[3](#fn3)</sup>

## 1 hour before cooking: drying and seasoning

1. take the chicken out of fridge to bring to room temperature<sup>[4](#fn4)</sup>
1. place a wire rack on a baking sheet
1. distribute chicken pieces evenly on wire rack
1. remove moisture from both sides of the skin; paper towels work fine, some even use a hair dryer
1. season the chicken with preferred spices, enough to cover all of skin evenly with a thin coat
  - not much salt is needed, as the meat has absorbed plenty
  - I like [Badia's southern blend poultry seasoning](https://badiaspices.com/product/poultry-seasoning-6-22-oz/), adding extra black pepper and garlic powder
  - Badia's [sazón completa](https://badiaspices.com/product/sazon-completa-complete-seasoning-12-5-5-oz/) and [adobo](https://badiaspices.com/product/adobo/) seasonings are also nice
  - Mexican style: cumin, lemon & lime zest, garlic powder, oregano, black pepper, cayenne, sugar
  - Autumn savory: sage, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, black pepper, sugar
  - if you want crispy skin, avoid seasoning with liquid flavorings (soy sauce, hot sauce, etc.) and include them for dipping or adding as needed at serving time

## cooking time

1. preheat oven to 450°
1. put chicken in when oven reaches 450°
1. cook for 30 minutes<sup>[5](#fn5)</sup>
1. drop temperature to 350°
1. when the breast's internal temperature reaches ~140°, rotate the baking sheet 180°<sup>[6](#fn6)</sup>
1. cook at 350° until breast and thigh reach 165°-170° internal temperature
1. remove from oven, rest for 15-30 minutes before carving and serving<sup>[7](#fn7)</sup>

<sup><a name="fn1">1</a></sup> this will help skin crisp when cooking, and so the meat can be salted directly and absorb faster. works for everything but wings, which are difficult to separate.

<sup><a name="fn2">2</a></sup> by weight gives the most consistent results. for kosher and sea salt, 6 grams = roughly 1 teaspoon.

<sup><a name="fn3">3</a></sup> salt needs to absorb for 24 hours; chilling uncovered will help skin dry out

<sup><a name="fn4">4</a></sup> bringing chicken to room temperature will help it cook faster and more evenly

<sup><a name="fn5">5</a></sup> the fat drippings off of your chicken may burn when they hit the baking sheet and cause your oven to smoke; to prevent smoking up your kitchen, keep the oven closed until a few minutes after you drop to 350°

<sup><a name="fn6">6</a></sup> ensures the chicken cooks evenly; most non-convection ovens don't hold the same temperature consistently and have hot spots

<sup><a name="fn7">7</a></sup> allows juices to redistribute evenly through meat before cutting, avoiding lost juices
